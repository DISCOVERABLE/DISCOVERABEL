						<p id="top">On DISCOVERABLE&trade; you can be paid for programming.<br>
						There are different types of payment methods so everyone can be fairly paid for the work they do. This
						allows fixable working for both the employer and employee.
						</p>
						
						<p id="NON">
							<h4>No Payment</h4>
							For this type of work you will not get paid. This work is for fun and when the code is submitted
							is no longer yours to own. This is just for small projects and people who like to code for fun.
						</p>
						
						<p id="PWH">
							<h4>Per Hour</h4>
							For this type of work you will will be paid. The amount you get paid will depend on the amount of time you work.
							The more you work the more you will get paid there may be a cap imposed e.g. Your being paid £12.97 an hour and you
							work for 100 hours you will be paid £1297.00, the employer can impose a cap such the cap may be £950 and this is what you will be eligible to be paid, as always
							the employer can pay the full £1297.00 if they are particularly pleased with the work carried out. It is up to the employee to prove and keep track of the hours worked.
							If the employee or employer feels that there is been unfair treatment they can raise the issue with us  <a href="#">here</a>.
						</p>
						
						<p id="OTP">
							<h4>One Time Payment</h4>
							One time payment allows the employee to get paid for a single job they do. This may include writing web page, a piece of code or 
							designing something. The amount that the employee will get paid is specified before the job is carried out. If the employer is unhappy
							with the work carried out they can refuse to pay; as always if the employee feels unfairly treated they can raise the issue with us <a href="#">here</a>.
						</p>
						
						<p id="PLC">
							<h4>Per Line Of Code</h4>
							This option will allow the employee to e paid. The amount they get paid is based on how many lines of code are completed Bank lines
							will not be counted neither will comments. e.g. The employee codes 1200 lines of code of these 1200, 97 are blank or comments. This will leave the employee
							having coded 1103, the pre determined rate was £0.005 per line this means the employee will be paid £5.515 the amount will be rounded to the nearest
							pence so the employee will be paid £5.52. If the employer is unhappy with the work carried out they can refuse to pay; as always if the employee feels
							unfairly treated they can raise the issue with us <a href="#">here</a>.
						</p>
						
						<p id="PTS">
							<h4>Per Job/Task Completed</h4>
							Being paid per job or task is very similar to a one off payment. The employer will set a list of jobs or tasks for the employee to do and for each
							task completed they will be paid. Different jobs and tasks can be set to be paid at different amounts such that a small task will be lower paid 
							than a larger more complex task. If the employer is unhappy with the work carried out they can refuse to pay; as always if the employee feels
							unfairly treated they can raise the issue with us <a href="#">here</a>.
						</p>
						
						<p id="VOL">
							<h4>Voluntary Payment</h4>
							The employer has no obligation to pay for any of the work done. If the employer feels that the work carried out if expectantly good a sum may be paid,
							the amount paid is completely up to the employer.
						</p>
						
						<p id="POA">
							<h4>Price On Application</h4>
							The amount paid for this job will be disclosed when the employee is accepted for the job. The amount and payment type
							may be discussed in a bilateral discussion between both parties, employee and employer, to determine how-much and what payment type
							there will be for the work. If the employer is unhappy with the work carried out they can refuse to pay; as always if the employee feels
							unfairly treated they can raise the issue with us <a href="#">here</a>.
